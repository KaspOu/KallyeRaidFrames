# Kallye Raid Frames

Modifications to Blizzards default raid/party frames according to my own preferences

1. **Changes to Blizzard CompactRaidFrames**
    - Highlight unit background depending on health:
       - - default from black, to yellow, then red
       - - options to change colors and %
    - Optionnal: revert HP bars (less life = bigger red bar !) (sRaidFrames like)
    - Transparency of units out of range
    - Skull icon added before dead players names.
    - Always show party frames
    - Roles icons
       - - Move role icons on top left
       - - Hides DPS role icons
    - Buffs/Debuffs
       - - Larger Debuffs
       - - Smaller buffs

2. **Changes to both CompactRaidFrames and Nameplates**
    - Removes servernames from the unitframe ( "Illidan (*)" instead of "Illidan - Varimathras" )
    - Change player name color according to class
