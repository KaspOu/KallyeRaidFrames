# Kallye Raid Frames
_EN / FR / RU_

Modifications to Blizzards default raid/party frames according to my own preferences.  
All features are optional.

1._**Always show Raid frames**
- Works while solo ^^

2._**Changes to Blizzard CompactRaidFrames**
- Highlight unit background depending on health:
  - default from black, to yellow, then red
  - options to change colors and %
- Invert HP bars (less life = bigger red bar !) (sRaidFrames like)
- Skull icon added before dead players names. **(NEW)**
- Transparency of units out of range
- Roles icons
   - Move role icons on top left
   - Hides DPS role icons
- Buffs / Debuffs Size
- Buffs / Debuffs Max display limit
- Buffs / Debuffs relative position (alpha)
- Buffs / Debuffs alignment / multiline
- Target icons (üíÄ‚ùåüî¥...) on raid frames

3._**Changes to both CompactRaidFrames and Nameplates**
- Removes servernames from the unitframe ( "Illidan (*)" instead of "Illidan - Varimathras" )
- Change players nameplate (on the head) color according to your preference (class color, custom color)
- Pvp Icons
- Show Players level option
